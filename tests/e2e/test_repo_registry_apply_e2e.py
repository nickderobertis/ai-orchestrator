"""Every repository keeps the policy it published under before `onevcs` owned the registry.

This host ran on a registry of its own until the adopted stack moved that mechanism
to `onevcs` — and moved none of the data, so `just repos` listed nothing and no
lifecycle dispatch could resolve a repository at all. `just repos-apply` is the
reproducible form of carrying it across, and what it carries is a merge path: an
identity re-registered a notch wider publishes to a base branch without the review
its repository requires, and nothing downstream notices.

So the pre-adoption registry is checked in at `tests/fixtures/pre-adoption-repos.json`
and this journey holds the tracked configuration to reproducing it. It builds a
checkout per pre-adoption checkout, carrying that repository's real origin, and
drives the real recipe with the real `config/onevcs.rules.yml` against a scratch
registry root — so what is asserted is what `onevcs` itself resolves, not a reading
of the YAML.

llmlint: ignore-file[e2e_not_mocked] The scratch checkouts stand in for this host's
own clones, which a test may not register or publish from; the recipe, the script,
`onevcs`, and git are all real, and the policy asserted is the one `onevcs` resolved.
